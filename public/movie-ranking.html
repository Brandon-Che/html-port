<h1>Chenny's Definitive Media Tier List</h1>
<h2>I literally don't wath anything</h2>

<hr>

<h3>1. Phineas and Ferb</h3>
<p>This show is one of the only shows I can rewatch, and for good reason. This shits a banger
    in both english and chinese. 
</p>

<h3>2. Cyberpunk Edgerunners</h3>
<p>I love the cyberpunk universe, so this show right up my alley. Also the story and animations in this series 
    is absolutely insane and gorgeous. I would recommend to everyone even if they don't like animated shows.
</p>

<h3>3. Literally don't know</h3>
<p>No other show sticks with me like the previous 2, so this shit is blank. I spend most of my time watching
    youtube or playing games.
